# FAQ

## Overview

**What is this tool?**

This is a tool to faciliate comparison of Ukulele string gaugues (diameter of strings) and tensions across diffent brands, materials, etc.

**Will there be support for non-standard string sets?**

Currently, only support for standard, four-string sets is contemplated. (Technically alternative tunings like for Baritone are supported, but it arguably makes the summary statistics noisier.)



## Data

**How can I get missing strings added to the tool?**

You can make a [new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/tkuriyama/uke-strings/issues) to request strings be added.

Even more helpful, you can use the "Generator" tab in the tool to input data and generate the format that the tool requires, then paste that into the GitHub issue.

For bulk data input (e.g. in CSV format), contact taro at tarokuriyama.com

## GUI


**How come tension isn't being displayed?**

It's most likely due to missing data. Tension data is only available for some strings. If data is not available, it defaults to 0.
