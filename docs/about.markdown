The companion notes page to the [Uke Strings Comparison app](https://tarokuriyama.com/ukestrings/).

Here, I collect casual notes on trying various ukulele string combinations.

Note that beyond the standard caveats of personal tastes in strings, I tend to prefer brighter sounding, lower tension sets for finger style playing.
