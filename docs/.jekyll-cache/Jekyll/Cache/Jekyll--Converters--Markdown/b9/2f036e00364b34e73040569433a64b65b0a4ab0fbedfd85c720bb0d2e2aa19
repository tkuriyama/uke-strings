<h3 id="visual--tactical-impression">Visual / Tactical Impression</h3>

<p>The S-1 are the default strings for the HF-1. As one would expect from Kamaka, they look very good on the Koa body.</p>

<p>On the fingers, smooth and plesant to pick. As with nylon strings in general, they are quite thick, with the C string diameter coming in over 1mm. Nut slots that have been carved for thin fluorocarbon strings may require widening.</p>

<h3 id="sound-impression--comparison">Sound Impression / Comparison</h3>

<p>The strings sound warm with very good intonation.</p>

<p>My preference is for the brighter tone of fluorocarbons. Compared to Fremont Black Line Medium strings, particularly with finger style, the Kamakas sound noticeably muted.</p>

<p>The same applies to the wound low G string, A thinner gauge strings like the Fremont Soloist produces a lot more resonance in the body (which can be felt on the HF-1, as much as it can be heard â€“ the low G is noticeably quiter than the other strinsg, given the small body).</p>
