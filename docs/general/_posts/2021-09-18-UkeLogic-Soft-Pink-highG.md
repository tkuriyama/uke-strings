## Strings: Uke Logic Soft High G (Pink)

| Name (Model)     | Uke Logic Sop / Con / Ten Soft Tension High G |
| Color / Material | Pink Fluorocarbon  |
| Url              | [The Uke Site](https://theukulelesite.com/accessories/strings/ukelogic-strings/ukelogic-soft.html?options=cart) |

These strings are sold by Joel at Hawaii Music Supply (via The Uke Site).

Compared to other fluorocarbon strings for tenor scale, the soft tension set is the narrowest on the A string and close to median on the rest of the strings. Given that the Uke Logic set is not differentiated across soprano / concert / tenor, though, the narrower gauge of the A strings is maybe unsurprising.

### Visual / Tactile Impression

The Uke Logic strings come in clear and pink fluorocarbon (the pink is a clearish pink, as seen below), with no difference in sound quality between the two colors.

The pink is purely a matter of visual taste. It is a nice option to have, and looks... fine against the Moon Bird's spruce top?

On the fingers, they are not materially diferent from other fluorocarbons. The tension on the soft tension set is comparable to the aNueNue Black Water tenor set.

### Sound Impression / Comparison

As fluorocarbons, the Uke Logic sound similar to the default aNueNue Black Water strings.

They seem to have more dynamic range, though, perhaps because they have greater range of thickness compared to the Black Water set (thinner on the A string and thicker on the G string). Overall, they are as good as any fluorocarbon set I've tried, with good tone and projection, and respond well to slides, vibrato, etc.


### Other Notes

None.
