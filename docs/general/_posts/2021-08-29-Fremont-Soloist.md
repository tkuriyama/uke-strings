### Visual / Tactical Impression

This is a single low-G string -- the "squakless" polished wound string, which has a much smoother texture than regular wound strings. 

It still makes more sound from friction than, say, fluorocarbon strings, but much less than a regular wound string and without the characteristic sound when sliding.

It looks natural on the "Quiet Shade" version of the UC-10 (which has silvery hardware on the tuning pegs).. Here it is paired with the default aNueNue Clear Water fluorocarbon strings:

### Sound Impression / Comparison

The Soloist is very resonant -- probably the most resonant low G strings I've tried.

The UC-10 is a naturally loud instrument (particularly given its concert size), and the aNueNue Clear Water strings are also quite loud, so the string set still sounds balanced. (On the Kamaka HF-1 Soprano, I preferred the [Aquila Red unwound low G](https://tkuriyama.github.io/uke-strings/general/2021/08/28/Aquila-Soprano-Unwound-Low-G.html), as it felt like the body couldn't fully channel the resonance of the Soloist).


### Other Notes

None.
