### Visual / Tactile Impression

The Living Water strings feel like... fluorocarbon. They are nice and smooth.

The Aquila Red unwound strings have their distinct textured feel, though it is much less noticeable on the thinner gauges. The tension is a bit higher as they are from the tenor set.

Overall, the two different string sets don't feel unnatural when strummed or finger picked together, though the Red series is maybe not the best visual match for the "Quiet Shade" version of the UC-10.

### Sound Impression / Comparison

The initial goal of the custom set was to try the Living Water fluorocarbons. Similar to the default aNueNue Clear Water strings, the E and A strinsg on the UC-10 were a bit too strident, so an ostensibly mellower set was mixed in for the E and A strings.

It may have been more natural to use a thicker gauge fluorocarbon for the E and A strings, but the Aquila Reds balance out the natural loudness and sharpness of the UC-10 well. I've had good experiences with the Aquila Red series in general, though Aquila notes they are fragile and need regular replacement.

As for the Living Water strings -- they sound good, but it's hard to distinguish them from the aNueNue Clear Water strings without a direct audio comparison (probably using a full set).

Overall, this set is the most balanced yet in terms of overall tone and volume for the UC-10.


### Other Notes

None.
