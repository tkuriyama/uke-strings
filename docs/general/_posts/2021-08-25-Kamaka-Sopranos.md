### Visual / Tactile Impression

The S-1 are the default strings for the HF-1. As one would expect from Kamaka, they look very good on the Koa body.

On the fingers, smooth and plesant to pick. As with nylon strings in general, they are quite thick, with the C string diameter coming in over 1mm. Nut slots that have been carved for thin fluorocarbon strings may require widening.


### Sound Impression / Comparison

The strings sound warm with very good intonation.

My preference is for the brighter tone of fluorocarbons. Compared to Fremont Black Line Medium strings, particularly with finger style, the Kamakas sound noticeably muted.

The same applies to the wound low G string, A thinner gauge strings like the Fremont Soloist produces a lot more resonance in the body (which can be felt on the HF-1, as much as it can be heard -- the low G is noticeably quiter than the other strinsg, given the small body).


### Other Notes

None.

### Sound Sample

None.
