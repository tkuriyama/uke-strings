## Strings: aNueNue Black Water Concert and Tenor

| Name (Model)     | aNueNue Black Water -- Concert (BWSC) and Tenor (BWT)                        |
| Color / Material | Dark Fluorocarbon |

### Visual / Tactile Impression

Visually, they are similar to other dark fluorocarbons like Worth Brown and Fremont Black Line.

On the fingers, again they feel very smooth, like typical fluorocarbons. They are about average thickness for dark fluorocarbon strings, with the Concert and Tenor sets sharing a C string of 0.78 mm (with the Concert set tapering to narrow gauges than the Tenor set).

I switched the default Tenor set on the UT-200 Moon Bird to the Concert set, for a slightly lower tension.

### Sound Impression / Comparison

The Black Waters sound very good on the Moon Bird, maybe marginally richer in tone than the Worth Brown (BT) set, though it's often hard to tell the difference.

They do seem to have slightly lower tension than the worth BT set, particularly when using the Concert instead of Tenor set.

As far as default strings go, the Black Waters are excellent and have all the brightness and project you'd expect from fluorocarbons. 


### Other Notes

The aNueNue strings are relatively expensive, at $11 and $13 for the Concert and Tenor sets from Hawaii Music Supply.

Worth fluorocarbon sets are around $12.5 - $14, but they are double length sets. Fremont Black Line sets (not low G) are between $7 - $8.

Given a choice, I'd probably choose the Black Waters for an aNueNue Bird series instrument, but would otherwise not reach for them first. 


### Sound Sample

None.
