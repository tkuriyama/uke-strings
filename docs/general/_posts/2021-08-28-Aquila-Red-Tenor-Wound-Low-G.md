### Visual / Tactile Impression

This is a single wound low-G string -- which is dark red and here paired with the default Worth Brown fluorocarbon strings that ship with the Sophia.

It is fairly noticeable against a bright wood like spruce -- but the mix with dark fluorocarbons doesn't look bad.

On the fingers, there is some good texture (as typical of wound strings), though not overly rough.

### Sound Impression / Comparison

The Aquila low G string pairs very well with the brightness of the spruce and the other (fluorocarbon) strings. It intones well and sounds balanced in the set, while still providing very good resonance.

It's maybe not quite as resonant as the [Fremont Soloist](https://tkuriyama.github.io/uke-strings/general/2021/08/29/Fremont-Soloist.html), but I haven't done a direct comparison on the Sophia. Since the Aquila's are advertised as wearing out quickly, there should be opportunity to comparea some new sets in the future.

Overall, it is a very pleasant low G string.


### Other Notes

I haven't noticed issues after playing the Red low G string periodically for over a month, but Aquila cautions that the Red series strings can wear out in weeks. If the cost or effort of regular replacement is too burdensome, it's a factor worth considering.


### Sound Sample

None.
