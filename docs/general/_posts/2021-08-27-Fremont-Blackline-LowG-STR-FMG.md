### Visual / Tactical Impression

The Fremont's are a dark fluorocarbon string, similar in look and feel to Worth Browns. They are more or less the same color as the default Kamaka dark nylon strings, and as such they look good on the HF-1.

The low G set comes with an unwound string of the same dark fluorocarbon material.

Compared to the hard tension set `STR-FH`, the A and G strings on the `STR-FM` are marginally thinner.

Overall they are very pleasant in look and feel.


### Sound Impression / Comparison

As fluorocarbon strings generally do, the Fremonts sound quite a bit more bright and clear compared to the [Kamaka nylon strings](https://tkuriyama.github.io/uke-strings/general/2021/08/25/Kamaka-Sopranos.html) that ship with the HF-1.

For mainly finger style, in particular, they are more suitable to my ears than the Kamaka nylons. 

The unwound low G string sounds quite a bit muted compared to the rest of the set. So, as far as comparison between the high G and low G sets go, the high G sounds much better on the HF-1.
