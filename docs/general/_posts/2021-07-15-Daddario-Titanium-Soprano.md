### Visual / Tactical Impression

visually, the purplish clear hue of the Titanium series is striking.

The strings have a nice, smooth feel and are noticeably thick, with the C string at 1.024 mm making it the thickest in the current D'Addario regular catalog for sopranos.

The thickness can require some additional work for restringing. On the Kamaka HF-1, which ships with thick nylon strings, it was no problem to set up. On the Enya soprano, which ships with fluorocarbons, the strings didn't fully fit into the nut slots.


### Sound Impression / Comparison

The Titaniums sound well-rounded but brighter than nylons (such as the Kamaka stock strings). They have good project, but are noticeably less bright and clear compared to fluorocarbons (Fremont Black Line Medium (STR-FM) on the Kamaka HF-1 and Worth Clear Medium (CM) on the Enya.

Presumably because of the thickness, there was a bit more sound that was noticeably on the attack.

Overall, they may produce good results for strumming, but for my mostly finger style, fluorocarbons still sound better on Kamaka and Enya.
