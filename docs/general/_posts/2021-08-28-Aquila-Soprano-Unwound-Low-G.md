### Visual / Tactical Impression

### Sound Impression / Comparison

The strings sound warm with very good intonation.

My preference is for the brighter tone of fluorocarbons. Compared to Fremont Black Line Medium strings, particularly with finger style, the Kamakas sound noticeably muted.

The same applies to the wound low G string, A thinner gauge strings like the Fremont Soloist produces a lot more resonance in the body (which can be felt on the HF-1, as much as it can be heard -- the low G is noticeably quiter than the other strinsg, given the small body).


### Other Notes

None.

### Sound Sample**

None.
