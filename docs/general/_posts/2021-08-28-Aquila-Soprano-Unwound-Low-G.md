### Visual / Tactile Impression

This is a single low-G string -- which is dark red and looks good on the HF-1 with dark fluorocarbons ([Fremont Black Line Medium](https://tkuriyama.github.io/uke-strings/general/2021/08/27/Fremont-Blackline-LowG-STR-FMG.html)

On the fingers, the unwound Aquila string has a distinct feel. For lack of a better analogy, it's a bit akin to thick paper, with a bit of grain. It doesn't squeak from touch, but does make a noticeable sound from the friction, especially when sliding.

As an unwound string, it is on the thicker side, at 0.95mm (compared to, say, the 0.914mm of the Fremont Soloist).

Overall, it's pleasant to my tastes.



### Sound Impression / Comparison

Although a low G string is unlikely to produce volume that's in line with other strings on the HF-1 (due do its soprano size), the Aquila sounds relatively balanced when used with Fremont Black Line Mediums. 

Compared to the unwound low G string that comes with the Fremont Black Line low G set, it sounds louder and more resonant. 

Compared to the Fremont Soloist (wound), it feels a less resonant, but maybe a bit brighter.

Overall, despite the limitations of a low G on a soprano, it produces a pleasant sound.
