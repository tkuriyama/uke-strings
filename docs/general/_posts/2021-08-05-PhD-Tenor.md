### Visual / Tactile Impression

By look and feel, the PhD strings are very similar to clear fluorocarbon strings.

I haven't been able to find any dimension or tension data, but they feel on the thicker side (comparable to some of the Worth Clears) and have relatively high tension (again, comparable to Worth Clears).

They are nice and smooth, though the tension on the Moon Bird (which maybe has a slightly high action) made it a bit difficult to play.


### Sound Impression / Comparison

Maybe due to the high tension, it felt difficult to get good projection when playing finger style.

Strummed, they sounded a bit duller than dark fluorocarbons on the same Moon Bird (both Worth Browns and the [aNueNue Black Waters](https://tkuriyama.github.io/uke-strings/general/2021/08/01/aNueNue-Black-Water.html)). I didn't have a set of Worth Clears to compare them against, but that might be a more direct point of reference given the thicker string gauge.

Overall, I found them to mute a little bit of the Moon Bird's natural brightness and resonance.


### Other Notes

None.


### Sound Sample

None.
